# about-me
My name is Dave Miranda.  I am an Executive Support Engineer (fancy way to
say overpaid helpdesk guy) for a small investment management firm in Boston. I
support the ivestment management team and all C Suite executives at my firm.
I am also responsible for mobile device management for all portable devices 
including iPhones, iPads, laptops, and tablets.  Aside form these main
responsibilities, I work on various projects from SharePoint design to
implementing platforms such as Ivanti for service desk and systems management.
